🧠 AI / ML Involvement

- The app sends user symptom queries to a language model (LLM) using the OpenRouter API.
- The backend uses natural language prompts to:
  - Validate if the input is a symptom or not.
  - Generate scheme suggestions and structured information.
- The model used is: `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`.
